                <p class="text-justify text-size mt-4">Corporate Social Responsibility for NGOs is the continuous commitment of a corporate body to improve community well being through discretionary business practices and ethical contributions of corporate resources. Mallen Baker—writer, speaker and CSR expert—defines Corporate Social Responsibility as a strategic act, "a way companies manage the business processes to produce an overall positive impact on society." Integrating social, environmental and ethical responsibilities into the governance of businesses ensures their long term success, competitiveness and sustainability. CSR initiatives facilitate corporate to build a dominant brand that reverberates with their key stakeholders—customers, employees, government and general public.
                    Real and long-lasting change can only be ushered in when all of us come together to make it possible. Inclination towards social responsibility and contribution to sustainable development is fast becoming the mark of distinction for leading corporate and top brands.</p>
