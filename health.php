                    A cataract is a cloudiness or opacity in the normally transparent crystalline lens of the eye. This cloudiness can cause a decrease in vision and may lead to eventual blindness. Globally, cataract has remained the major cause of blindness over the years. Approximately 45 million people are blind worldwide, out of which cataract accounts for 17.6 million (39%) cases. Southeast Asian region contributes to 50-80% of all blindness. A cataract is the leading cause of blindness in people above 50 years, according to the National Blindness and Visual Impairment Survey India 2015-19. The condition is behind 66.2 percent blindness cases, 80.7 percent severe visual impairment cases and 70.2 percent moderate visual impairment cases in the age group. And these could have been avoided — around 93 percent of blindness cases and 96.2 percent of visual impairment cases in this age group were avoidable. Of all the avoidable causes, more than half were treatable, found the survey. Also, blindness is more pronounced among illiterates (3.23 percent) than literates (0.43 percent) and more prevalent in the rural population (2.14 percent) than urban (1.80 percent), found the AIIMS survey.

                    Cataract is the principal cause of blindness for people above 50 years in India. Cataract is the cause for 66.2% cases of blindness, 80.7% cases of severe visual impairment, and 70.2% cases of moderate visual impairment in the age group. Blindness is more pronounced among illiterate (3.23%) than literates (0.43%) and more prevalent in the rural population (2.14%) than urban (1.80%). Approximately 93% of cases of blindness and 96.2% visual impairment cases in this age group were avoidable. Barriers to accessing treatment include no one to accompany [the patient], seasonal preferences, and financial constraints.
